                            be liable for any costs, expenses, loss or penalties imposed or loss or damage incurred by any SHOPTINS Indemnitee
                            due to your Shipment or Goods being impounded by customs or other Government Authorities, and you hereby
                            protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each SHOPTINS Indemnitee against any such cost,
                            expense, fine, penalty or loss. 23. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms and Conditions,
                            SHOPTINS will not be liable for any costs, expenses, loss, fines, or penalties imposed or loss or damage
                            incurred by any SHOPTINS Indemnitee due to your breach or non-compliance of any of these Terms and Conditions
                            and you hereby protect, indemnify, release, safeguard, and hold harmless each SHOPTINS Indemnitee against any
                            such cost, expense, fine, penalty or loss. Limitation of Liability 24. SHOPTINS will be responsible for your
                            Shipment only while it is within SHOPTINS or SHOPTINS Affiliate’s custody or control, subject to the limitations
                            of liability set out herein. 25. If the Shipment is transported by air and involves a stop in a country other
                            than the country of departure, you understand and acknowledge that an Airfreight Convention may apply and
                            may limit liability for loss or damage.<br><br> Your claim for any loss or damage occurring during carriage by air,
                            is against the airline carrier. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are
                            in the possession of the airline carrier, SHOPTINS will seek to recover amounts payable under the applicable
                            Airfreight Convention on your behalf, and you indemnify SHOPTINS and hold it harmless against any claims for
                            loss or damage to your Goods incurred while they were in the possession of the airline carrier. If the
                            Shipment is carried by international road transportation, the Convention for the International Carriage
                            of Goods by Road (CMR) may apply. This convention limits SHOPTINS’s liability for loss or damage. 26. You
                            acknowledge that Goods moved by airfreight may necessarily involve a part of transport undertaken by other
                            means. Where this is so, and no international treaty is applicable which covers the additional transport,
                            your recovery of loss or damage, if any, is against the carrier and may exclude or substantially limit
                            liability. In the event of any loss or damage suffered by you while the Goods are in the possession of a
                            third party carrier, SHOPTINS will seek to recover from the carrier any amounts payable to you.
                            You indemnify SHOPTINS and hold it harmless against any claims for loss or damage to your Goods
                            incurred while they are in the possession of the third party carrier, where such carriage was necessary
                            in order to complete the delivery of your Shipment. 27. Without limiting the effect of clauses 20-23, and
                            subject to clauses 28-29 below, in all cases where SHOPTINS’s liability is not otherwise limited or excluded,
                            SHOPTINS’s liability shall be limited to whichever is the lesser between (i) the value of the Goods the subject
                            of the shipment at the time the Goods were delivered to SHOPTINS, or (ii) US $100 per shipment, or
                            its equivalent per shipment. 28. To the extent that the liability of SHOPTINS is limited by any Airfreight
                            Convention, law or contract, and that limitation exceeds the limitation of liability pursuant to clause 27
                            above or Accountable Mail below, then the liability pursuant to that Airfreight Convention, law or contract
                            shall apply. 29. Any claim for loss or damage must be notified in writing to SHOPTINS within seven (7) days
                            of delivery of the Goods or of the date upon which the Goods should have been delivered. In any event,
                            SHOPTINS and/or SHOPTINS Affiliate shall be discharged from all liability whatsoever in connection with the
                            Services and/or the Goods unless proceedings are served within 90 days from delivery of the Goods
                            (or from when they should have been delivered). 30. In addition to SHOPTINS’s standard liability above,
                            SHOPTINS offers an optional protection plan for shipments against all risks of physical shipment loss or
                            damage from any external cause. 31. Country Notices. Qatar Residents. This clause applies to Customers
                            located in Qatar only. The Terms and Conditions are in compliance with the Electronic Commerce and
                            Transaction Law No. 16 of 2010. 32. Accountable Mail In the event that SHOPTINS agrees to accept Accountable
                            Mail on your behalf, then in consideration for SHOPTINS’s doing so, you agree that SHOPTINS’s liability for
                            loss or damage is limited to the lesser of (i) the value of the Goods, or (ii) US $100. 33. <br><br>Consequential
                            Losses SHOPTINS will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential loss or damage
                            of any kind or any loss of profit, reputation, income, interest, opportunity, contract or bargain. Force
